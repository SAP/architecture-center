The **Quick Start** tool uses GitHub OAuth for user authentication. This means that users are redirected to GitHub to log in and authorize the application. No passwords or direct authentication data are handled or stored by the **Quick Start** tool.

Personal Data Processed:
- GitHub Username
- Public Profile Information (e.g., name, profile picture, email if made public)
- Repository Access Token (scoped access provided by the user to fork, commit, and create pull requests)

This data is used solely to perform GitHub actions on behalf of the user such as forking repositories, committing changes, and creating pull requests.
No personal data is shared with third parties or used for marketing, analytics, or advertising purposes.
The **Quick Start** tool itself does not set or store any cookies.
However, GitHub may set cookies during the OAuth login process (which is outside the **Quick Start** tool’s control).
