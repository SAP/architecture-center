## Cookie Statement

This Cookie Statement was update on **04-Nov-2025**.

This Cookie Statement describes how SAP (hereinafter also “We”, “Our”) uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and store information when you visit **[SAP Architecture Center](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/)**. SAP’s Privacy Statement applies in addition to this Cookie Statement. SAP’s Privacy Statement informs you about the way SAP uses, stores and protects personal data collected.

## What are Cookies and similar technologies?

Cookies are small files placed on your device (computer, tablet or smartphone). When you access a website, a cookie is placed on your device and it will send information to the party that placed the cookie. There are other technologies performing a similar function to cookies. These include inter alia web beacons, clear gifs, and social plug-ins. These are often used in conjunction with cookies to help a website owner understand its users better.

## What are first party Cookies?

SAP’s websites contain first party Cookies. First party cookies are cookies that are specific to the website that created them. These cookies enable SAP to operate an efficient service and to track patterns of user behavior to SAP’s website.

## What are third party Cookies?

The difference between a first party cookie and a third party cookie relates to who places the cookie on your device. SAP sometimes allows third parties to place Cookies on your device. Third party cookies are placed on your device by a third party (i.e., not by SAP). While SAP allows third parties to access SAP’s website to place a third-party cookie on your device, SAP does not retain control over the information supplied by the cookies, nor does SAP retain access to this information. This information is controlled wholly by that third party according to the respective privacy policy of the third party. For more information about these Cookies, please click the “Cookie Preferences” link in the footer of the webpage.

## Analytics and Digital Marketing in the United States of America
In the United States SAP routinely works with third party analytics and digital marketing providers who facilitate and support SAP (and partner) marketing activities including targeted communications. These activities may involve the sharing of limited Personal Information (personal identifiers and contact information, your interests and interactions with SAP, professional/employment information) for those specific business purposes. In addition to the above, SAP may also share your personal data with other third parties, or for other business purposes, with your explicit consent. SAP endeavors to recognize common opt-out preference signals at a browser level, and frictionlessly exclude you from marketing cookies and associated tracking.

## What cookies are used?**
SAP wants you to be in a position to make an informed decision for or against the use of cookies which are not strictly necessary for technical features on **[SAP Architecture Center](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/)**. If you elect to reject cookies used for advertising, you will be shown advertising that is less targeted to your interests. This will still allow you to use all of the functionality of **[SAP Architecture Center](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/)**. 

When tracking and evaluating the usage behavior of users of the Web Presence by means of cookies or similar technologies includes the processing of your personal data, SAP conducts the processing based on the following legal permissions:
- GDPR Article 6.I (a) if it is necessary that We ask you for your consent to process your personal data,
- GDPR Article 6.I (b) if necessary to fulfill (pre-)contractual obligations with you,
- GDPR Article 6.I (f) if necessary to fulfill (pre-)contractual obligations with the company or other legal body you represent as a customer contact (legitimate interest to efficiently perform or manage SAP’s business operation),
- or equivalent legal permissions under other relevant national laws, when applicable.

SAP differentiates between Required Cookies that are absolutely necessary to enable technical core functionalities, Functional Cookies that allow SAP to analyze the site usage, and Advertising Cookies that are used to serve ads relevant to your interests.

## How can you manage and delete Cookies?

SAP provides you with the option to adjust your preferences for Functional and Advertising Cookies when such cookies are placed on your device. In such a case, you can access preferences at any time by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link in the footer of the **[SAP Architecture Center](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/community/cookie)**].
