We are the **Office of the CTO**, driving the development and engagement of SAP’s Architecture Center. 

We enable community **collaboration** and **innovation** by providing a modern, GitHub-based platform for building, publishing, and governing SAP reference solution architectures.

## Our Team Structure
The Architecture Center does not operate with a traditional, fixed team. Instead, it relies on a dynamic network of contributors who collaborate with us on a temporary basis. These contributors include individuals from our organization as well as external partners.
This flexible team structure is a deliberate choice that brings several advantages:
- Flexibility: Without the constraints of a rigid team, we can adapt quickly to changing needs and priorities.
- Creativity: This open contributor model fosters diverse perspectives and innovative ideas, enhancing our ability to create impactful architectural solutions.
- Collaboration: By engaging with a broad community, we harness a wide range of expertise and experiences, enriching the outcomes of our efforts.
Embracing this non-traditional team approach enables the Architecture Center to remain agile and continuously evolve, while encouraging active participation and knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries.

## The core team

They have been there from the very beginning, contributing to everything from framework exploration to small proof-of-concepts, while also shaping the architecture and governance.

A special thanks goes to our **content creators**, whose work is the foundation of this site.
