<p>Dear Community of Practice,</p>
<p>I am beyond excited to share some groundbreaking news: we are launching the <strong>SAP Architecture Center</strong> internally! This has been a long time coming, and I know many of you will agree that it is a much-needed shift in how we collaborate, document, and share our technology architectures.</p>
<p>For far too long, our approach to Reference Solution Architectures (RSA) has relied on PowerPoints—bulky, hard to version-control, and ineffective for collaborative iteration. While we’ve had other platforms like the SAP Discovery Center, the existing model has been largely static, with a single-contributor approach that makes it difficult to maintain and evolve architectures over time. This needs to change, and we are here to make it happen!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-model-for-architectural-collaboration">A New Model for Architectural Collaboration<a href="https://architecture.cloud.sap/@preview/cernus76-changing-versioning-before-go-live/blog/2025/02/01/announcing-the-internal-launch-of-sap-architecture-center#a-new-model-for-architectural-collaboration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A New Model for Architectural Collaboration" title="Direct link to A New Model for Architectural Collaboration">​</a></h2>
<p>Enter the <strong>SAP Architecture Center</strong>: a GitHub-based repository that revolutionizes how we build, publish, and govern Reference Solution Architectures. If you’ve worked with any major cloud technology vendors, you know that GitHub is the industry standard for version control and collaboration. It’s time for SAP to embrace this best practice and take our architectures to the next level.</p>
<p>With this new model, we’re not just publishing architectures—we’re fostering a <strong>true Community of Practice</strong>. Our contributors (that’s you!) can now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborate seamlessly</strong> across teams within and outside of SAP.</li>
<li><strong>Version control architectures</strong> just like software code.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute, enhance, and evolve</strong> architectures together rather than relying on a single maintainer.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure governance and quality</strong> with structured review and approval workflows.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>GitHub as the Core Platform</strong>: We are moving away from static models to a collaborative, scalable, and version-controlled approach.</li>
<li><strong>draw.io for Solution Diagrams</strong>: An open-source, industry-standard tool for creating architecture diagrams—enabling better collaboration and easy updates.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with SAP Discovery Center &amp; Learning Center</strong>: No matter where users enter, they will have a unified experience with our curated architectures.</li>
<li><strong>CPA Approach &amp; Community Contributions</strong>: We already have CPA included as part of our initial content, and we invite you to contribute, enhance, or even build your own.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Architecture Validator (Coming Soon)</strong>: We are working on an AI-driven tool that will validate new architectures for anti-patterns, syntactic errors, and provide intelligent recommendations.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are soft-launching the <strong>SAP Architecture Center internally at d-com 2025</strong>. This is your opportunity to be among the first contributors, test the workflows, and help shape the platform.</p>
<p>But that’s just the beginning! Our external launch is planned for <strong>SAPPHIRE 2025</strong>, by which time we aim to have at least ten high-quality architectures published. And we’re not stopping there—our goal is to <strong>double that number by the end of the year</strong>.</p>

<p>We need <strong>your</strong> expertise, passion, and creativity to make the <strong>SAP Architecture Center</strong> a success. Whether you’re a solution architect, a domain expert, or just someone who cares about well-structured technology blueprints, this is your chance to be part of something transformative.</p>
<p>Let’s build, innovate, and create together.
<strong>Happy Architecting!</strong></p>
