This has been a long time coming, and I know many of you will agree that it is a much-needed shift in how we collaborate, document, and share our technology architectures.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFor far too long, our approach to Reference Solution Architectures (RSA) has relied on PowerPoints\u2014bulky, hard to version-control, and ineffective for collaborative iteration. While we\u2019ve had other platforms like the SAP Discovery Center, the existing model has been largely static, with a single-contributor approach that makes it difficult to maintain and evolve architectures over time. This needs to change, and we are here to make it happen!\\n \\n## A New Model for Architectural Collaboration\\nEnter the **SAP Architecture Center**: a GitHub-based repository that revolutionizes how we build, publish, and govern Reference Solution Architectures. If you\u2019ve worked with any major cloud technology vendors, you know that GitHub is the industry standard for version control and collaboration. It\u2019s time for SAP to embrace this best practice and take our architectures to the next level.\\n\\nWith this new model, we\u2019re not just publishing architectures\u2014we\u2019re fostering a **true Community of Practice**. Our contributors (that\u2019s you!) can now:\\n- **Collaborate seamlessly** across teams within and outside of SAP.\\n- **Version control architectures** just like software code.\\n- **Contribute, enhance, and evolve** architectures together rather than relying on a single maintainer.\\n- **Ensure governance and quality** with structured review and approval workflows.\\n\\n## Key Features of the SAP Architecture Center\\n1. **GitHub as the Core Platform**: We are moving away from static models to a collaborative, scalable, and version-controlled approach.\\n2. **draw.io for Solution Diagrams**: An open-source, industry-standard tool for creating architecture diagrams\u2014enabling better collaboration and easy updates.\\n3. **Integration with SAP Discovery Center & Learning Center**: No matter where users enter, they will have a unified experience with our curated architectures.\\n4. **CPA Approach & Community Contributions**: We already have CPA included as part of our initial content, and we invite you to contribute, enhance, or even build your own.\\n5. **AI-Powered Architecture Validator (Coming Soon)**: We are working on an AI-driven tool that will validate new architectures for anti-patterns, syntactic errors, and provide intelligent recommendations.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\n \\nWe are soft-launching the **SAP Architecture Center internally at d-com 2025**. This is your opportunity to be among the first contributors, test the workflows, and help shape the platform.\\n \\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning! Our external launch is planned for **SAPPHIRE 2025**, by which time we aim to have at least ten high-quality architectures published. And we\u2019re not stopping there\u2014our goal is to **double that number by the end of the year**.\\n\\n## Call to Action\\nWe need **your** expertise, passion, and creativity to make the **SAP Architecture Center** a success. Whether you\u2019re a solution architect, a domain expert, or just someone who cares about well-structured technology blueprints, this is your chance to be part of something transformative.\\n\\nLet\u2019s build, innovate, and create together.\\n**Happy Architecting!**\\n\\nThe Office of the CTO"},{"id":"/2025/01/29/launch-of-architecture-center","metadata":{"permalink":"/@preview/xammaxx-fix/114-fallback-image/blog/2025/01/29/launch-of-architecture-center","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-29-launch-of-architecture-center.md","title":"SAP Architecture Center","description":"The SAP Architecture Center centralizes all resources in one place, enabling organizations to maximize cloud capabilities while ensuring that their solutions are secure, resilient, and optimized to their specific requirements.","date":"2025-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.855,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"James Rapp","title":"SAP Architect","url":"https://github.com/jmsrpp","page":{"permalink":"/@preview/xammaxx-fix/114-fallback-image/blog/authors/jmsrpp"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/jmsrpp","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-rapp-40a6311/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/jmsrpp.png","key":"jmsrpp"},{"name":"Pierre-Olivier Basseville","title":"Program Manager / Product Owner","url":"https://github.com/cernus76","page":{"permalink":"/@preview/xammaxx-fix/114-fallback-image/blog/authors/cernus-76"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/cernus76","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierreolivierbasseville/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/cernus76.png","key":"cernus76"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"SAP Architecture Center","description":"The SAP Architecture Center centralizes all resources in one place, enabling organizations to maximize cloud capabilities while ensuring that their solutions are secure, resilient, and optimized to their specific requirements.","authors":["jmsrpp","cernus76"],"keywords":["SAP Architecture Center","Reference Architecture","SAP BTP"],"hide_table_of_contents":true,"date":"2025-01-29T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing the Internal Launch of SAP Architecture Center","permalink":"/@preview/xammaxx-fix/114-fallback-image/blog/2025/02/01/announcing-the-internal-launch-of-sap-architecture-center"}},"content":"## Introducing the SAP Architecture Center\\n\\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of the SAP Architecture Center, a new platform dedicated to creating, exploring, sharing, and advancing the world of reference architectures in the SAP ecosystem.
