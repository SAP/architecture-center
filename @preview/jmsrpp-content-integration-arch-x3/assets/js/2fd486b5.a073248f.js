This is a huge step forward in how we collaborate, document, and share our technology architectures, and I know many of you will agree that it\'s a much-needed change.\\n\\nFor too long, we\'ve relied on PowerPoints for our Reference Solution Architectures (RSA)\u2014cumbersome, difficult to version-control, and not great for collaborative iteration. While we\'ve had other platforms like the SAP Discovery Center, the existing model has been largely static, with a single-contributor approach that makes it tough to maintain and evolve architectures over time. It\'s time for a change, and we\'re making it happen!\\n\\n## A New Way to Collaborate on Architectures\\n\\nThe **SAP Architecture Center** is a GitHub-based repository that revolutionizes how we build, publish, and govern Reference Solution Architectures. If you\'ve worked with any major cloud technology vendors, you know that GitHub is the industry standard for version control and collaboration. It\'s time for SAP to embrace this best practice and take our architectures to the next level.\\n\\nWith this new model, we\'re not just publishing architectures\u2014we\'re fostering a **true Community of Practice**. Our contributors (that\'s you!) can now:\\n\\n* **Collaborate seamlessly** across teams within and outside of SAP.\\n* **Version control architectures** just like software code.\\n* **Contribute, enhance, and evolve** architectures together rather than relying on a single maintainer.\\n* **Ensure governance and quality** with structured review and approval workflows.\\n\\n## Key Features of the SAP Architecture Center\\n\\n* **GitHub as the Core Platform**: We\'re moving away from static models to a collaborative, scalable, and version-controlled approach.\\n* **draw.io for Solution Diagrams**: An open-source, industry-standard tool for creating architecture diagrams\u2014enabling better collaboration and easy updates.\\n* **Integration with SAP Discovery Center & Learning Center**: No matter where users enter, they will have a unified experience with our curated architectures.\\n* **CPA Approach & Community Contributions**: We already have CPA included as part of our initial content, and we invite you to contribute, enhance, or even build your own.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nWe\'re launching the **SAP Architecture Center** globally at SAPPHIRE 2025. This is your opportunity to be among the first contributors, test the workflows, and help shape the platform.\\n\\n## Call to Action\\n\\nWe need your expertise, passion, and creativity to make the **SAP Architecture Center** a success. Whether you\'re a solution architect, a domain expert, or just someone who cares about well-structured technology blueprints, this is your chance to be part of something transformative.\\n\\nLet\'s build, innovate, and create together. Check out the Community of Practice section to learn how [you can start contributing](/community/contribution) today.\\n\\nHappy Architecting!\\n\\nThe Office of the CTO"}]}}')}}]);
