These methods, however, lacked collaborative authoring capabilities, robust version control, and ease of iterative refinement. To address these limitations, we\'ve transitioned to a modern, collaborative solution using GitHub, a widely recognized platform among developers and architects.\\n\\n#### What is the SAP Architecture Center?\\nThe SAP Architecture Center is a GitHub-based repository designed to enhance how we build, publish, and govern Reference Solution Architectures. Each architecture is managed through Markdown files on [GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/architecture-center), supporting transparent collaboration, robust version control, and structured governance. Solution diagrams utilize draw.io, an open-source tool, and integrate seamlessly into our official [Solution Diagrams repository](https://sap.github.io/btp-solution-diagrams/), managed by Fabian Lehmann.\\n\\n#### How does it work?\\n- Efficient collaboration across teams.\\n- Robust version control for architectures.\\n- Collective enhancement and evolution of architectures.\\n- Structured governance with clear review and approval workflows.\\n\\n#### Architecture Center Vision\\n![Architecture Center Vision](images/architecture-center-vision.png)\\n\\n:::info Disclaimer\\nThis diagram represents the holistic vision of the SAP Architecture Center, combining both current capabilities and future roadmap elements. Some features are forward-looking and may evolve over time as the platform continues to develop.\\n:::\\n\\n#### What\'s next? \\nSAPPHIRE 2025 was our initial launch milestone, marking the start of this journey. Moving forward, we have several strategic enhancements planned:\\n1. **Automated Architecture Validator** with Joule Interface: Solution diagrams will include embedded service metadata, enabling AI-powered automated validation and testing through Joule.\\n2. **Integration with Learning Journeys**: Enhanced integration with SAP Learning Center Learning Journeys for certifications and accreditations, along with closer alignment with SAP Discovery Center\u2019s service catalog and missions.\\n3. **Expanded Architectures**: New architectures in data and agentic AI\u2014including open-source collaborations such as A2A interoperability\u2014and additional architectures addressing non-functional requirements like HA/DR, security, and observability.\\n\\nSpecial acknowledgment to [Philipp Herzig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-herzig/) and [Andre Bechtold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abechtold/) for sponsorship, the core team: [James Rapp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-rapp/), [Pierre-Olivier Basseville](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierreolivierbasseville/), [Navya Khurana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navya-khurana-1b78a6187/), [Fabian Lehmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lehmann-fabian/), [Michael Still](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-still-b3aaa2133/), [Marina Noble](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinanoble/), [Adi Pleyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adi-pleyer-5844923/), [PVN PavanKumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavankumarpvn/), [Julian Schambeck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-s-41b9a8253/), [Johanna Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannagondi/), [Vedant Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedant-gupta-ai/), [Gabriel Kevorkian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-kevorkian-30005b2/), [Robin Purschwitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-purschwitz/), [Max Lienhardt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-lienhardt-a2a157335/), Jonas Mohr, [Praveen Padegal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveenkumarpadegal/), and all contributors.\\n\\nJoin us in shaping the future of SAP architecture.\\n\\n[Start contributing](/community/contribution) today!\\n\\nAnirban\\nOffice of the CTO\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e"}]}}')}}]);
