<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I'm super excited to share some amazing news with you all: we're launching the <strong>SAP Architecture Center</strong> globally! This is a huge step forward in how we collaborate, document, and share our technology architectures, and I know many of you will agree that it's a much-needed change.</p>
<p>For too long, we've relied on PowerPoints for our Reference Solution Architectures (RSA)—cumbersome, difficult to version-control, and not great for collaborative iteration. While we've had other platforms like the SAP Discovery Center, the existing model has been largely static, with a single-contributor approach that makes it tough to maintain and evolve architectures over time. It's time for a change, and we're making it happen!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-way-to-collaborate-on-architectures">A New Way to Collaborate on Architectures<a href="https://architecture.learning.sap.com/@preview/cernus76-update-blog/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-the-launch-of-sap-architecture-center#a-new-way-to-collaborate-on-architectures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A New Way to Collaborate on Architectures" title="Direct link to A New Way to Collaborate on Architectures">​</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>SAP Architecture Center</strong> is a GitHub-based repository that revolutionizes how we build, publish, and govern Reference Solution Architectures. If you've worked with any major cloud technology vendors, you know that GitHub is the industry standard for version control and collaboration. It's time for SAP to embrace this best practice and take our architectures to the next level.</p>
<p>With this new model, we're not just publishing architectures—we're fostering a <strong>true Community of Practice</strong>. Our contributors (that's you!) can now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborate seamlessly</strong> across teams within and outside of SAP.</li>
<li><strong>Version control architectures</strong> just like software code.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute, enhance, and evolve</strong> architectures together rather than relying on a single maintainer.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure governance and quality</strong> with structured review and approval workflows.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub as the Core Platform</strong>: We're moving away from static models to a collaborative, scalable, and version-controlled approach.</li>
<li><strong>draw.io for Solution Diagrams</strong>: An open-source, industry-standard tool for creating architecture diagrams—enabling better collaboration and easy updates.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with SAP Discovery Center &amp; Learning Center</strong>: No matter where users enter, they will have a unified experience with our curated architectures.</li>
<li><strong>CPA Approach &amp; Community Contributions</strong>: We already have CPA included as part of our initial content, and we invite you to contribute, enhance, or even build your own.</li>
</ul>
