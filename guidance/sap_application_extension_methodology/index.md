We want to support Enterprise Architects in assessing their extension use cases and defining an extension target solution in a structured and formalized way.

The SAP Application Extension Methodology can support and guide you by providing a structured, technology-agnostic approach for customers and partners to define an organization-specific extension strategy.

If you face complex challenges like ‘clean core’, ‘cloud readiness’, and ‘future proof’ concepts, it’s mandatory to come up with a custom-tailored extension strategy for your organization.

This is where the SAP Application Extension Methodology can support and guide you.

Following this methodology will ensure that everyone in your project uses the same terminology and quickly arrives at a common understanding of the business use case and to-be solution. You’ll have an overview of possible technical extension building blocks and you’ll be able to make an informed decision about your organization’s future extension architecture. You’ll be able to define an extension framework, to provide guidance for the internal audience of architects and developers.

**Phases of the SAP Application Extension Methodology**

The SAP Application Extension Methodology is a three-phase cycle that is open to SAP and third-party technologies.

You can follow this methodology either for a specific use case (start with Phase 1) or use it to define your extension strategy and governance (start with Phase 2).
