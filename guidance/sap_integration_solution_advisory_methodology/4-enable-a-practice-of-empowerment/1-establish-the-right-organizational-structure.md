## Context

Enterprise integration is a team exercise where employees of various roles are performing specific tasks in orchestration to achieve a common goal such as the delivery of integrated business applications or business processes that are integrated end-to-end.

For this purpose, the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology includes a list of frequently used integration roles in organizations, together with their typical responsibilities and some sample activities in an SAP context. The concrete definition of integration roles depends on your specific customer context. You can use the outlined integration roles as a starting point and adapt/extend them to your specific needs.

Furthermore, you need an organizational unit that owns and continuously evolves the integration strategy of your enterprise: The SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology recommends introducing an Integration Center of Excellence. This is a cross-departmental team of experts from various disciplines with different perspectives – lines of business whose applications and data are directly affected by integration – as well as representatives from compliance and security. The Integration Center of Excellence is driving the adoption of the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology in an organization. Thus, this team is responsible for the following activities:

-   Defines and oversees the execution of an enterprise integration strategy
-   Designs and oversees the implementation of the hybrid integration platform
-   Defines and oversees the adoption of integration best practices across the organization’s virtual integration community
-   Provides integration enablement and coaching

This team also takes care to coach the organization’s virtual integration community that may include integration developers, citizen integrators, and a subset of API/application developers \(the ones working on integration-related developments\) in order to establish standards and to harness and advancee competency within the organization. It is important that the Integration Center of Excellence is well connected with other strategic IT units such as an Enterprise Architecture Board and executive sponsoring is ensured.

Such an Integration Center of Excellence can not only optimize tactical integration projects but can also empower strategic initiatives by delivering data access, insights, and intelligence with the help of standardized and scalable APIs to business users, developer experts, executive managers, and data analysts. This is accomplished by accelerators to enable not only data access but also data insights and intelligence, and executive reporting.

The high-level organizational structure for IT that includes enterprise integration, too, is typically defined by the Chief Technology Officer \(CTO\) together with the Human Resources department.

## Procedure

You use a template for performing this step as you can’t define integration roles in regard to responsibilities and tasks in Integration Assessment. However, as part of Integration Assessment a subset of these roles is being reused. Thus, it provides role collections for an enterprise architect, integration architect and business domain expert, which are the personas using this tool.

1.  Templates-based approach

      
      
    **Integration Roles Template**

    ![](images/loio83a5ca6002324ea7acfafd5c2d3dedf3_LowRes.png "Integration Roles Template")

    Download the “Integration Roles Template” and fill it out as follows:

    1.  Review the scope of integration roles, including their responsibilities and sample tasks. Adapt them if needed.
    2.  For each relevant role, you can add company-specific information \(in section “Organizational Unit/Employees”\) such as responsible organizational units and/or specific employees.

2.  Tool-based approach

    A descriptive definition of integration roles is not supported by the Integration Assessment capability within SAP Integration Suite. Please use the templates-based approach instead \(see above\).
