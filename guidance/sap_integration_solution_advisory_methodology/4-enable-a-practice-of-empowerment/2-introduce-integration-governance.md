## Context

After you’ve defined your enterprise integration strategy you need make sure that your virtual integration community is executing on it, for instance that integration scenarios are being designed and implemented in a consistent fashion based on agreed upon standards. By doing so, you can deliver enterprise-grade integration scenarios to safeguard your company's mission-critical business processes. Integration governance includes organizational structures to oversee the adoption of integration technology to create value and manage associated risks.

As integration technology belongs to the information technology practice within an organization, integration governance needs to contribute to the overall IT governance process. This includes defined responsibilities and escalation paths: Whenever strategic decisions regarding the integration architecture are required, they must follow the overarching enterprise architecture strategy. In such cases the Integration Center of Excellence team needs to align such decisions with the Enterprise Architecture Board. The latter one is also consulted in case of escalations within the Integration Center of Excellence team. The highest level of enterprise architecture decisions and technology selection is owned by the Chief Technology Officer. The graphic below shows a simplified example of an organizational structure for integration governance.

The SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology includes a set of templates that you can apply along a governance process for integration developments. The following graphic shows an example of an integration governance process, including involved roles, tasks per role and applicable accelerators.

The concepts and templates of this methodology can help integration developers to identify the right integration technology and approach based on agreed upon integration best practices. If no existing integration technology can fulfill the requirements, the developer can consult the Integration Center of Excellence for advice.

The approach for integration governance needs to comply with the overarching IT governance process within an organization. The concept for the latter one is typically being defined by the Chief Technology Officer, which builds the foundation for an integration governance approach that is detailed out by integration architects belonging to the Integration Center of Excellence.

## Procedure

For this step no template is available: As integration governance is a continuous activity, it is important to embed it as integral part of the integration development process. Hence, it isn’t sufficient to define an integration governance approach using a template as a one-off exercise. It’s recommended to leverage the Integration Assessment capability within SAP Integration Suite for introducing integration governance across decentralized integration development teams.

1.  Templates-based approach

    There is no template for this step available. Leverage Integration Assessment instead \(see Tool-based approach below\).

2.  Tool-based approach

    Perform this step using the Integration Assessment capability within SAP Integration Suite.
