Integrating end-to-end processes whether these span SAP, partner, or third-party solutions is a top priority of SAP’s integration strategy aimed at delivering an integrated, intelligent suite of SAP business applications.

SAP’s integration approach goes far beyond technical integration of applications: Comprehensive integration of data, technology, and business processes delivers significant business value such as accelerated speed of innovation.

A key element of this strategy is the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology. It helps you to define, document, and execute a strategy for enterprise integration to increase the integration maturity level in your organization. The methodology offers a framework that includes integration use case patterns, architecture blueprints, and additional best practices for cloud and hybrid IT landscapes. Its scope isn’t limited to technical aspects, but also covers the organizational dimension of enterprise integration like setting up an Integration Center of Excellence and defining integration roles including their tasks. It is an open framework whose concepts you can apply to integration technologies from SAP or the ones from other vendors. You can also adapt and enrich its concepts and content according to your needs. A well-defined adoption path allows you to apply the methodology in your organization step by step.
