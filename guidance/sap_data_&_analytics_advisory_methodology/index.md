The SAP Data & Analytics Advisory Methodology provides a comprehensive framework for enterprise and data architects to evaluate data strategies, develop solution architectures, and foster a data-driven culture in a structured four-phase approach.

### Introduction

Data is crucial for organizations because it serves as the foundation for informed decision-making and strategic planning. By collecting, analyzing, and leveraging data, organizations can gain valuable insights. Therefore, data and analytics play a central role in your organization when shaping your digital strategy and transformation.

The SAP Data and Analytics Advisory Methodology is a comprehensive guide designed to support enterprise architects, data architects, and professionals in executing data strategies, developing and validating solution architectures for data-driven business outcomes, and nurturing a data-driven culture.

This methodology represents an architecture development approach based on standard enterprise architecture frameworks, especially The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and SAP Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAP EAF).

Structured into four phases, each with specific steps and deliverables, the methodology enables successful execution of data initiatives. It does so by applying well-known architecture development frameworks (SAP EAF/TOGAF), tailoring phases based on scope, and leveraging existing techniques and tools.

The structured process is accompanied by the following:

- a **data domain reference model** to establish a common understanding of SAP data

- a **data & analytics capability model** to better support the architecture definition

- data-driven **use-case patterns** and related **reference architectures** to accelerate solution architecture development

The methodology also considers the organizational impact that new data & analytics capabilities and solutions might have, and how governance processes need to be adapted. Finally, it supports an open data ecosystem consisting of related third-party software products of hyperscalers or SAP partners.
