# [SAP Architecture Center](https://architecture.cloud.sap)

Reference architectures are templates in their simplest form. They generalize specific implementations of software with a common set of components, vocabulary, or configuration. In the SAP context, this means showing how applications, data, and AI operate at the product and service level, and how you can take advantage of repeatable best practices to optimize your SAP cloud and on-premises investments.

A reference architecture outlines the interactions between various services, showcasing how they work together seamlessly. It also demonstrates how these services integrate with business applications from SAP, partners, and third-party providers. This holistic view helps organizations understand the components needed to build a cohesive and efficient system. These templates provide a standardized approach to designing systems, ensuring best practices and optimal configurations are followed. They can easily be customized or adapted to a customer's unique environment and provide a foundation for adopting the latest cloud innovations from SAP.
