<p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of the SAP Architecture Center, a new platform dedicated to creating, exploring, sharing, and advancing the world of reference architectures in the SAP ecosystem. While our site is still in its early stages of development, we are excited to share our vision and invite you to be part of this journey from the very beginning.</p>
