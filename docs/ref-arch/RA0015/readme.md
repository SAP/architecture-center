# Business-to-Government Integration Reference Architecture

## Overview
In many countries or regions, organizations must comply with local requirements mandating the submission of electronic documents such as invoices, summaries, transport registrations, and statutory reports to external communication parties. Depending on the exchange model, these documents are transmitted through an authority, a regulated service provider, a regulated network, or directly to the business partner. The actual exchange of data may be fully electronic or require manual download or upload.

This reference architecture follows the **SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology**, defining B2G integration as an integration use case pattern under the process integration style. It covers integration domains such as Cloud2Cloud and Cloud2OnPremise.

1. **Electronic Exchange Using SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition**:
   - SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition, is a managed cloud service running on SAP BTP. It centralizes compliance processes across enterprises, eliminating the need for localized solutions for each country or scenario.
   - It supports business scenarios using the Peppol network or local authorities. Peppol facilitates electronic procurement across jurisdictions, enabling document exchanges such as invoices.
   - The SAP Connectivity Service is used for selected scenarios, while SAP Application Interface Framework enables monitoring and error handling.
   - Predefined integration flows ensure secure electronic exchanges via AS4 connectivity or local authority platforms.

2. **Electronic Exchange Using SAP Integration Suite**:
   - SAP Integration Suite facilitates the exchange of electronic documents and statutory reports. Secure connections are established using SAP Connectivity Service, Cloud Connector, and SAP Destination Service.
   - Predefined integration flows from SAP Business Accelerator Hub ensure formatted document submission to tax authorities.

3. **Manual Data Exchange**:
   - SAP solutions generate output files meeting local authority formatting requirements. Business users upload these files via web portals or manually enter data into authorities' platforms.
