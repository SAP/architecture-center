## Flow: 

Prerequisite is to migrate and deploy an Esri ArcGIS geodatabase in SAP HANA Cloud. This is easily done via few clicks and details can be obtained here:

https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geodatabases/manage-saphana/create-geodatabase-saphana.htm

There are 3 different data flows depending on personas:

- [Geospatial analyst utilizing Esri tools and UI](#geospatial-analyst-with-esri-tools-and-ui)
- [Application developer](#application-developer)
- [Geospatial analyst using SAP tools and UI](#geospatial-analyst-using-sap-tools-and-ui)

### Geospatial analyst with Esri tools and UI 

**A Geospatial Analyst persona using Esri tools to access combined SAP and Esri data in HANA Cloud is depicted in ***GREY*** and looks like:**

1. The process begins with loading the Esri ArcGIS geodatabase with geospatial data via the tools that come with Esri ArcGIS, such as ArcGIS Pro/Desktop, ArcGIS Portal, third-party tools such as FME, etc. The analyst can then create a ArcGIS [Query Layer](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/layer-properties/what-is-a-query-layer-.htm) (see https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/layer-properties/what-is-a-query-layer-.htm ) via Esri ArcGIS Pro to combine the GIS data and SAP enterprise data in the SAP HANA Cloud calculation view.
2. Those Esri tools are natively connected to Esri Geodatabase or Esri Utility Network Utility model, which are already deployed as database artifacts in SAP HANA Cloud.
3. The analyst can create a calculation view in SAP HANA Cloud that combines the Esri ArcGIS data with SAP enterprise data via CDS views. Data is joined in a SAP HANA Cloud calculation view which is built on top of Esri Geodatabase and CDS from S/4 HANA joining Esri and SAP data.
4. Data is read from SAP HANA Cloud (federated or replicated) and underlying source systems as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Business Warehouse or other sources.

### Application developer

**An Application Developer persona will follow a different process, depicted in ***PINK***, which looks like:**

1. The SAP Business Technology Platform provides services and capabilities, including the SAP Business Application Studio for development. The Business Application Studio is the first place where a developer can code CAP applications. A CAP application built on SAP BTP can utilize geospatial data stored in an ESRI Geodatabase on SAP HANA Cloud.
2. For data modeling with CDS, the developer can define entities that represent customers' geospatial data and the joined data from the HANA Cloud Calculation View. CDS annotations can handle geospatial data types such as ST_Point, ST_Geometry, or ST_Polygon. Associations can be defined between entities to model relationships, such as linking geospatial locations with business objects like assets, customers, or orders. Once the models are defined, OData services can be exposed using the CAP framework, and custom service handlers can be implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript or Java. Throughout this process, the Application developer can make adjustments and optimizations to the Geospatial app to ensure smooth data flow and integration according to business requirements.
3. The CAP app connects to SAP HANA Cloud. Within SAP HANA Cloud, the Esri geospatial data is stored and can be combined with existing business data from SAP S/4HANA or other source systems.
4. Data is read from SAP HANA Cloud (federated or replicated) and underlying source systems such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Business Warehouse or other sources.

### Geospatial analyst using SAP tools and UI
**A Geospatial Analyst persona using SAP tools and a Fiori UI is depicted in ***BLUE*** and looks like:**

1. a Geospatial Analyst might use a Fiori Application written and developed for specific business needs.
2. The CAP (Node.js) Geospatial app connects to SAP HANA Cloud which is running as a Esri geodatabase.
3. Within SAP HANA Cloud, the geospatial data is stored and can be combined with existing business data. SAP HANA Cloud processes HANA Calculation Views where data is joined between the Esri Geodatabase and CDS from S/4HANA, bringing spatial and business data together.
4. Data is read from SAP HANA Cloud (federated or replicated) and underlying source systems like SAP S/4HANA, SAP Business Warehouse or other sources.
