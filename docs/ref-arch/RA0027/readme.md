SAP Architecture Center Test Document

The **SAP Architecture Center** is an **open-source, GitHub-based** **repository** that redefines how architectures are created, reviewed, and maintained. Each architecture is authored using Markdown files with full version control, transparent review workflows, and integration of **draw.io**

diagrams from SAP’s official Solution Diagrams repository.

## Problem Statement

Historically, documenting and sharing technical architectures at SAP relied on fragmented tools such as PowerPoint presentations and static websites.

These methods lacked collaborative authoring, version control, and structured governance, making it difficult to ensure accuracy, consistency, and scalability across teams.

## Project Goal and Scope

The goal was to build a unified, collaborative, and transparent platform for authoring, managing, and publishing SAP Reference Solution Architectures.

To achieve this, the **SAP Architecture Center** was developed as an **open-source initiative** on GitHub, enabling community-driven collaboration and knowledge sharing. The project aims to modernize the way SAP and its ecosystem create and govern architectures—enhancing agility, transparency.

innovation across the organization.
