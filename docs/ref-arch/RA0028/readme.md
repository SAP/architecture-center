# Introduction

Customer orientation has always been at the core of our operations. ​

However, our products sometimes do not match the requirements resulting out of customers’ challenges and needs.

Therefore, as Customer Innovation, we can:​

- **Leverage** the **customer connection** to obtain new insights from our hands-on customer engagements.
- Promote this **feedback** to our **development** organization.
- **Improve quality of our products**.

Once you have shared feedback with the corresponding DEV or PM team (via JIRA or another tool, including emails), you should add this activity into our F2D JIRA. You might not always be able to add a link to the issue you created in the F2D JIRA (e.g. with emails).

Our F2D JIRA can be accessed here: [https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/F2D](https://sapjira.wdf.sap.corp/browse/F2D)

**ℹ️ Note**: It takes few seconds to completely load JIRA

**ℹ️ Note**: JIRA supports the following browsers:

- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox (all platforms)
- Google Chrome (Windows and Mac)
- Safari (Mac)

# First contact with JIRA

Here is a typical JIRA screen. Depending on the JIRA project you select, there might be some variations.



**Search**

**Create issue**

**Sort & Filter**

**Details for the current issue**

**List of issues**

**ℹ️ Tip**: You can sort (change the default order) or filter the issues here.



**ℹ️ Tip**: The people associated to the issue are always located on the right side of the issue.

**ℹ️ Tip**: If you click the ***View all issues and filters*** link on the top right of the screen, you will be able to refine the displayed issues.



**ℹ️ Tip**: It is possible to Hide or Display the sidebar by clicking on the **<< **or **>>** at the bottom left of the screen.



# Create an issue into JIRA (F2D)

Here is a popup window which will appear once you click the **Create** button.



## Step 1

Click on the **Create **button located on top part of the page.

## Step 2

Make sure to select **F2D** in the project drop-down list box.



## Step 3

Select the type of issue. It can be one of the following:

- Incident (F2D)
- Feature Request (F2D)
- Info Request (F2D)
- Strategic Feedback (F2D)

## Step 4

The summary is a very important field. It must describe in a few words what the issue is.

Moreover, it should start with the product name or acronym (e.g. SAC, SCP, RPA, CAI…) followed by a colon “:” and the description of the issue.

**Example**: **SAC: Add the page numbers in Set Filter**

## Step 5

The Request Context field can be seen as the ongoing project name. If there is more than one project realized for one customer, it will help us to identify to which project the issue belongs to.

⚠️ Please note that you must replace space between words with an underscore.

**Example**: **Ottogi_Ramen_marketshare_forecasting**

## Step 6

Enter the partner(s) if this is relevant.

## Step 7

Enter the customer’s name. If there is more than one customer, separate the names with space.

⚠️ Please note that you must replace space in a customer’s name with an underscore.

**Example**: **John_Deere**

## Step 8

Enter the priority of the issue. It can be one of the following:

- Low
- Medium
- High
- Very High

## Step 9

You have the possibility to add attachments to the issue. It can be screenshots, logs, issue descriptions or any other relevant information which helps to qualify the issue.

## Step 10

You can briefly enter a description. Most of the time, the summary previously entered is enough.

## Step 11

Enter the Reporter’s name. If you did not directly work on the issue, this is the person’s name who brought up the issue. The system will search your contact while you are typing.

## Step12

Enter the Assignee’s name. It should be the name of a champion (e.g. the lucky person responsible for your region) during the roll-out phase. The system will search your contact while you are typing.

## Step 13

Enter the Receiving Team’s name in this field. It is often difficult to properly identify the team working on he issue you previously created.

To make this step easier, you can use [https://people.wdf.sap.corp/](https://people.wdf.sap.corp/) and search for either the **Org Unit**’s name of the person assigned to the issue (DEV or PM only – Not F2D). If the **Org Unit**’s name is not explicit enough, you can choose **Cost Center**’s name instead.

**Example**: **TI_HA_X_Eng_Ana_Cloud_QA_Client**

⚠️ Please note that you must replace space between words with an underscore.

⚠️ Without this information, you will not be able to change the status of the issue to **Handed Over**.

## Step 14

Enter the name of the person assigned to the issue on the DEV or PM side. You can also enter the D/I/C number of the person. The system will search your contact while you are typing.

⚠️ Without this information, you will not be able to change the status of the issue to **Handed Over**.

## Step 15

You have the possibility to add a link to reference the issue which has been created in another JIRA project (DEV or PM).

To do so, you have to click on the **More** drop-down menu and select **Link**.



Once it is done you will get a pop-up window like this one:



Make sure to select the right Server in the drop-down box. Most of the time it is either **SAPJIRA** or **JIRA@NGP**.

Last, enter the reference of the issue. The system will search while you are typing. Once you find the issue you are looking for, just click on it.





# Additional information

We also have made a video to demo the creation of an issue. Make sure to watch it.

If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to contact one of the champions from your region.

Last but not least, as always, any feedback is more than welcome.
