# Greenfield Implementation of SAP BDC and SAP S/4HANA with SAP-managed Data Products and Insight Apps

## Introduction

Customers with SAP S/4HANA 2021 can get provisioned with SAP BDC. UCL Services(Unified Customer Landscape) will be used to create the BDC formation to include SAP S/4HANA system with SAP Business Data Cloud. With this, the metadata of Data Products will be shared with BDC Cockpit, Datasphere Catalog and Business Accelerator Hub and bring data from SAP S/4HANA to BDC's Foundation Services Layer. SAP BDC Foundation Services in SAP Managed Service which has SAP-managed Object Store and other technical services to transform and publish data products from SAP systems. 

This architecture pattern is about installing and consuming SAP managed data products in SAP Analytics Cloud as an Insight Application which is pre-delivered by SAP.

## Installing, Activating and Visualizing a standard SAP S/4HANA Data Product

### Producing a Data Product in SAP S/4HANA PCE

A **data product** is a curated, self-contained collection of tables and business data, made accessible for consumption by external applications or services via standardized APIs. In SAP S/4HANA, data products are generated by exposing relevant datasets through APIs and enriching them with comprehensive metadata. This metadata is structured as an Open Resource Discovery (ORD) document, which provides a detailed description of the data product, including its purpose, structure, and access mechanisms.

### Installing and Activating a Data Product in SAP Datasphere

Installation is the process to entirely activate associated data products and also install the content within SAP Datasphere and SAP Analytics Cloud. As a result dashboards can be directly consumed. SAP Datasphere offers robust data mart capabilities, advanced data integration tools, and seamless support for both native and derived data products. The platform is designed to simplify the consumption, management, and publication of data products across the organization.

1. **Review and Install the Data Product:** Examine the data productâ€™s summary, sample data, included objects, terms of use, and supporting documentation to ensure it aligns with your analytical requirements. Preview a sample dataset for validation, or directly install the data product into a designated SAP Datasphere space for further modeling and analysis.

2. **Activate Data Packages:** Activation is the process of making the baseline data and the relevant data products of a data package available. Data and models are present within the foundation services. The data products can be discovered and installed through the catalog.

### Visualizing a Data Product in SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)

For advanced visualization and planning, **SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)** is the recommended solution for both embedded and standalone analytics scenarios. SAC seamlessly integrates with SAP Datasphere, enabling users to transform data products into actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reports. The embedded (OEM) version of SAC further enhances performance with a streamlined viewer and offers cost efficiencies via a shared application tenant.

**Visualization steps include:**

1. **Establish Connectivity:** Ensure SAP Analytics Cloud is connected to the SAP Datasphere environment where the data product resides.
2. **Model the Data:** Consume analytical models in DSP based on the deployed data product, leveraging its semantic richness for accurate analysis.
3. **Develop Dashboards:** Design and publish dashboards and reports in SAC to visualize key metrics, trends, and business outcomes.

By following this streamlined approach, organizations can efficiently produce, deploy, and visualize standard SAP S/4HANA data products-unlocking faster, more reliable insights and maximizing the value of their SAP data landscape.

## Architecture

With the current release of SAP BDC and Insight Applications, customer can choose to either leverage the pre-delivered content as-is with Insight Application or customize the analytical model of the pre-delivered content to develop custom insight applications.

Insight packages include data products, base and analytical models and pre-defined SAC visualizations and planning templates/search-driven insights/KPI watchlist. In SAP-managed insight app, data products will be in SAP Foundation Services Layer, Base Models and Analytic Models will be in Datasphere and Visualizations can be in SAC/BTP.

### High Level Setup Steps prior to installing and using the SAP Insight Apps.

1. Required systems are provisioned (SAP Datasphere Tenant, SAC Tenant, SAP S/4HANA PCE, Optional : SAP Databricks). BDC Cockpit will be available once the formation has been created in SAP BTP. 
2. Install relevant components in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud.
2. Setup Inbound Communications for SAP S/4HANA.
3. Setup Outbound Communication for SAP S/4HANA.
4. Setup Cloud Connector.
5. Create the formation.



### SAP Delivered Insight App

In this pattern, the SAP-managed data products are installed. The end user uses the standard insight application via SAP Analytics Cloud.Insight Apps are pre-built analytical applications within SAP BDC. They help you quickly discover hidden insights and make faster decisions. They are fully managed by SAP, built on curated BDC data products, Datasphere models, SAC stories and include predefined metrics, AI models, and planning tools. 

SAP Managed Data Products:
- These are fully managed by SAP throughout their lifecycle.
- The data is stored within the Foundation Service (FOS) HDLFS, which is not directly accessible to customers.

### Customization of SAP Delivered Insight App

In this pattern, the underlying SAP Datasphere Analytical models and SAP Analytics Cloud stories can be copied and customized leveraging the SAP-managed data products.

## Services and Components

- **SAP BDC Cockpit**: Centralized management interface for SAP BDC.
- **SAP Datasphere**: Centralized data management platform supporting self-service, semantic onboarding, and integration with data marketplaces.
- **SAP Analytics Cloud:** Provides advanced analytics and visualization capabilities.
- **Data Products**: Standardized datasets for AI/ML and cross-domain analytics.A dataset exposed for consumption outside the boundaries of the producing application via APIs and are described by high quality metadata, semantically aligned that can be accessed through the Data Product Directory.
- **Data Packages**: Logical grouping of Data Products. These are to be considered if the data products provided shall be used as foundation for modelling in SAP Datasphere or for AI/ML scenarios in SAP Databricks.
- **Insight Apps**: Pre-built applications for actionable intelligence.Low-code apps that are composed from data products, data models and SAP SAC Content. SAC Content serves as a demonstrations for the user of the underlying data products to fulfill a specific analytics use case. Customers can leverage and extend the underlying data products to adjust the analytical layer as per specific requirements.


## Examples in an SAP Context

SAP will be publishing Insight Apps across all application pillars. For e.g Core Enterprise Analytics, People Analytics, Spend Analytics, Customer Analytics, Supply Chain Analytics and Partner Ecosystem Apps.

Few of the examples of Insight Apps with the offerings are mentioned below:

:::info Note
Not all the below mentioned ones are GA
:::

- Core Enterprise Analytics: Enabling companies to effectively make use of current assets and maintain sufficient cash flow to meet short-term goals and obligations. The Insight App provides details on how was the working capital trending over past few periods, average payment period for account payable etc. E.g Working Capital, Sales Analysis etc.
- People Analytics: Enabling customers to understand thier workforce composition and organization structure. E.g: Employee Central, Learning etc
- Spend Analytics: The Insight App will provider comprehensive overview of spend when it is spread across multiple applications. Provides hidden linkages between suppliers etc. E.g: Spend Control Tower, Procurement Analysis etc.

Similarly, there will be Insight Apps available across Customer and Supply Chain Analytics as well.

## Conclusion

Using SAP's pre-build data products and insight apps provide complete business view of the most critical business processes across all SAP applications. This ensures consistency and business context with SAP-managed data sets and semantics. Adopting SAP Data products offers comprehensive lifecycle management which removes the overhead of building a trusted data foundation.
