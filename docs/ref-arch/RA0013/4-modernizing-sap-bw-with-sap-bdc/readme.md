## Introduction

SAP Business Warehouse (BW) has been a cornerstone of enterprise data management for decades, providing essential insights for decision-making. However, the growing complexity of modern data landscapes, the need for real-time analytics, and the shift toward AI-driven processes demand a more scalable and integrated approach. SAP Business Data Cloud (SAP BDC) offers a path to modernize BW environments, enabling organizations to leverage existing investments while transitioning to a future-ready architecture.


With the introduction of SAP BW, private cloud edition in SAP BDC, SAP offers customers options to lift from 
-  SAP BW NetWeaver to SAP BW 7.5 on HANA Private Cloud Edition to benefit from maintenance support until end of 2030
-  SAP BW/4HANA to SAP BW/4HANA Private Cloud Edition with maintenance support until 2040.

As a result, customers can gradually shift SAP BW use cases to SAP Datasphere and replace respective data flows with proven capabilities within SAP Datasphere as well as data products and Intelligent Applications within SAP Business Data Cloud, instead of spending time and budget on a migration.

## Architectural Overview

![drawio](drawio/bw-bdc-detailed.drawio)

SAP BW 7.5 on HANA Private Cloud Edition or SAP BW/4HANA Private Cloud Edition, is the Data Producer. This system is added in the SAP BDC Formation. With this addition, a dedicated provisioning space is created for SAP BW PCE. Data Product Generator is a tool which is available in SAP BW PCE to create data products in Object Store in SAP BDC out of BW PCE. These data products gets generated as custom data products in the object store which is in the SAP BDC Tenant. From the provisioning space in SAP Datasphere, this can be shared with another space for modeling and consumption into SAP Analytics Cloud.

## Key Services and Components

The modernization process leverages the following components to transition BW environments to SAP BDC:

- **SAP BW 7.5 on HANA Private Cloud Edition, SAP BW/4HANA Private Cloud Edition,**: Private cloud edition of BW for transitioning to BDC.
- **Data Product Generator:** Enables creation of SAP BW data products for integration into SAP Datasphere.
- **SAP Datasphere**: Centralized data management platform supporting self-service, semantic onboarding, and integration with data marketplaces.
- **SAP Analytics Cloud:** Provides advanced analytics and visualization capabilities.
- **SAP Databricks:** Supports AI/ML scenarios on unified SAP BW and SAP BDC data.
- **Data Products**: Standardized datasets for AI/ML and cross-domain analytics.
- **Intelligent Applications**: Pre-built applications for actionable intelligence.
- **SAP BDC Cockpit**: Centralized management interface for SAP BDC.

## High-Level SAP BW Modernization Approach

Migration projects require careful planning to ensure continuity and minimize disruption. SAPâ€™s approach addresses key enterprise concerns:

-   **Data Continuity**: Comprehensive validation ensures consistency and integrity during migration, with a focus on preserving historical data and business rules.
-   **Operational Stability**: Parallel operations during transition phases reduce business disruption, supported by robust fallback mechanisms.
-   **Capability Development**: Tailored training programs ensure teams can effectively manage and utilize the new SAP BDC environment.
-   **Security and Compliance**: Enterprise-grade security controls and compliance frameworks protect data and support audit requirements.

SAP provides a structured three-step approach for migrating SAP BW systems to the Business Data Cloud. This methodology focuses on leveraging existing BW data, transitioning to modern data products, and adopting a scalable, cloud-native architecture.

**The key benefits of SAP BW 7.5 on HANA Private Cloud Edition, SAP BW/4HANA Private Cloud Edition as part of SAP BDC are:**

-   SAP BW data products can be leveraged in SAP Databricks for ML/AI use cases and in SAP Datasphere for analytics scenarios, allowing the native implementation of BW use cases while following a zero copy approach.
-   The HANA Data Lake Files (object store) will be the large system option, reducing associated storage costs.
    Additionally, customers will benefit from data products and delta share mechanism, allowing a direct consumption in SAP Databricks for AI/ML use cases.
-   The Spark Engine enables custom coding options to replace existing ABAP code.
    In addition, Spark offers scalable compute capabilities supporting high-volume transformations. Spark compute is isolated from the analytics compute, avoiding mutual performance impact.

### Three-Step Migration Process

**1. Lift to SAP BW 7.5 on HANA Private Cloud Edition, SAP BW/4HANA Private Cloud Edition**: Transition existing SAP BW NetWeaver or SAP BW/4HANA on-premises deployments into the private cloud edition of SAP BDC. This step secures SAP BW investments while exposing SAP BW data as data products for consumption.

**Migration Pathways: Structured Transition Options**

The migration pathway depends on the current SAP BW system landscape. Below is a visual representation of the available paths, and the recommended approaches based on the environment:

**2. Shift to SAP BW Data Product:** 

The data product generator for SAP Business Data Cloud allows users to automate the publication of valuable BW data from SAP BW and SAP BW/4HANA systems to the object store of SAP Datasphere in SAP BDC. These data can be leveraged as data product and incorporated in SAP Datasphere projects or shared to third-party-tools.

Note: the object store is not a cold store alternative, but enables SAP BW data product consumption and exposure.

![drawio](drawio/bw-approach-2.drawio)

**SAP BW Data Product**

-   **Base Data Product:** contains the flattened transactional data of the selected InfoProvider including master data which can be e.g. directly leveraged by SAP Databricks for ML/AI use cases via Delta Share.
-   **Refined Data Product:** consists of local tables that contain the transactional data and pre-defined associated dimensions, i.e. master data out-of-the-box for analytics use cases and can also be exposed via SQL Share. (To be available)
-   **Derived Data Product:** uses the refined data product to define analytical measures or it includes the respective defined key figures, filters etc. - ready to use to gain further business insights and can also be consumed via OData.(To be available)

With Data Product Generator, Data subscription is created in SAP BW Cockpit for Info Provider. Once the subscription is activated, local table is created in specific BW Inbound space in SAP Datasphere. Multiple subscriptions can be created similarly.

Once the Run Subscription is executed, the data from Info Provider gets loaded into Local Table(file)into the SAP BW inbound space. Objects in this space are read-only, but data management tasks (e.g. deleting data) are possible. With Merge Task in SAP Datasphere, data will be synced from Inbound Table to Target Table. 

To create a Data Product, a context should be provided that represents the SAP BDC formation to which the Datasphere tenant is added.
To include artifacts into the Data Product, the source space of the artifact has to be selected. For Delta Sharing, the respective tables have to be already available within the dedicated BW space.

We can select one or multiple tables which should be exposed through the Data Product.

With this, SAP BW Data product will be available for modelling and transformation purposes in SAP BDC. With delta share with SAP Databricks, proven SAP BW Data can be used for implementing AI/ML use cases. Update of data can be scheduled in a delta mode.

**3. Innovate with SAP Managed Data Products and Intelligent Applications:** 

With the Data Products in SAP BDC, holistic integration between data platforms and business applications is possible. This helps to develop Intelligent applications for insights and business decisions.

![drawio](drawio/bw-approach-3.drawio)

Along with SAP BW Data Products and all other LoB Data Product, one of the approaches for building AI/ML applications can be achieved using (SAP) Databricks - SAP Databricks and Native Databricks. This is optimized to work with SAP Data Products with zero-copy bi-directional data product sharing.

From SAP Datasphere's Catalog, the BW Data Product can be shared with (SAP) Databricks. Once the AI/ML analysis has been performed in SAP Databricks, the output from the table in SAP Databricks needs to be enriched and then can be shared back to the SAP-managed Datasphere's space.

Refer to [SAP Business Data Cloud SDK](https://pypi.org/project/sap-bdc-connect-sdk/) to be able to create and publish Data Products for downstream consumption within SAP BDC. SDK helps to create/update share, create/update the CSN for a share and publish/unpublish a data product.

For customers who are already using Databricks Data Intelligence Platform, BDC Connect(Partner Connector) from SAP help integration for brownfield scenarios.This will enable zero-copy sharing of data products bidirectionally based on Delta Sharing. 


**Replacing SAP BW Use Cases with SAP Business Data Cloud**

With SAP BDC, SAP BW use cases can be gradually transitioned with SAP BDC with SAP-managed data products and Intelligent Applications, adopting a lakehouse architecture.

![drawio](drawio/bw-transformations.drawio)

SAP managed data products and Intelligent Applications allow customers to consume and create analytics scenarios, following a clean core principle. Below are approaches at high-level to plan for replacing SAP BW use cases:

Reporting:
-   Query and Composite Provider to be replaced with an Analytic Model and View using the onboarding in the catalog.

Data Foundation:
-   SAP BW Data is pushed via the Data Product Generator into the object store of SAP Datasphere.
-   Re-routing of data provisioning to SAP S/4HANA RISE/PCE and Foundation Service.
-   Replace Standard Data Sources with SAP managed Data Products.
-   Translate transformations from SAP BW into Transformation Flows in SAP Datasphere.
-   Replace and repoint existing Location Tables(files) based on SAP BW Data to Local Tables with data from SAP S/4HANA.
-   Access custom data sources via replication flows in SAP Datasphere and push the data into Local Tables(File).
-   Access Non-SAP Data sources via replication flows in SAP Datasphere and push the data into Local Tables(File).
